    "   - Describe tools you've mastered and examples of effective use.\n",
    "      - During this trimester, I have mastered using postman, VScode, terminal, UML, and github. In CSP I gained a little bit of familiarity with all of these tools but I was still unsure with how to use them. This trimester, while integrating with my new team, I learned how useful these can be when making something that requires an API, especially postman. Postman was really useful to me when testing out my endpoints before developing a frontend that didn't wotk and then having to change the entire thing. it was really interesting to learn how to analzye the message bodies and see how they are actually working with the game. I also had to deal with a lot of troubleshooting with my game, so using console logs and run + debug was really useful. Being able to solve those problemswas really satisfying for me! Additionaly, I learned how to make pull requests on github, and do things like deal with merge conflits, which had to be done often given we were working with a large team.\n",
    "2. **Programming Skills**  \n",
    "   - Demonstrate your skill in the programming languages used.\n",
    "      - This trimester I leanred how to do backend API work with Java, which I've never done before. I have a little bit of prior experience with Java, but that was just making small turtle games, so it eas interesting to see how that knowledge helped me make an actual fullstack game. I gained even more experience with frontend work, which I felt i was already okay in. \n",
